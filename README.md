# Bank-Management-System
#Introduction#
A Bank Management System is a software application developed to efficiently manage and automate essential banking operations such as customer account management, deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries. In today’s digital era, manual handling of banking transactions and records is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. This system provides a computerized solution that ensures accuracy, speed, and reliability in maintaining customer information and financial transactions.
The main purpose of developing this Bank Management System is to offer a simple, secure, and user-friendly platform for both administrators and customers. It allows administrators to add and view customer details, while customers can easily log in to check their balance, deposit or withdraw money, and view their account information.
The system is implemented using the C++ programming language and demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, objects, encapsulation, and abstraction. It uses data structures like vectors for dynamic data storage and includes input validation to ensure data integrity.
This project not only helps in understanding the practical application of OOP concepts but also illustrates how software can streamline traditional banking processes. It can be further enhanced by incorporating file handling for permanent data storage, user authentication systems, and graphical interfaces to make it suitable for real-world banking environments.
