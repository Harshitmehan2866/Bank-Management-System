# Bank-Management-System

Introduction

A Bank Management System is a software application developed to efficiently manage and automate essential banking operations such as customer account management, deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries. In today’s digital era, manual handling of banking transactions and records is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. This system provides a computerized solution that ensures accuracy, speed, and reliability in maintaining customer information and financial transactions.

The main purpose of developing this Bank Management System is to offer a simple, secure, and user-friendly platform for both administrators and customers. It allows administrators to add and view customer details, while customers can easily log in to check their balance, deposit or withdraw money, and view their account information.

The system is implemented using the C++ programming language and demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, objects, encapsulation, and abstraction. It uses data structures like vectors for dynamic data storage and includes input validation to ensure data integrity.

This project not only helps in understanding the practical application of OOP concepts but also illustrates how software can streamline traditional banking processes. It can be further enhanced by incorporating file handling for permanent data storage, user authentication systems, and graphical interfaces to make it suitable for real-world banking environments.

Conclusion

The Bank Management System project provided valuable hands-on experience in applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, objects, encapsulation, constructors, and data abstraction. Through this project, key learnings include designing modular code, managing data efficiently, and implementing secure user interactions.

This project enhanced the understanding of how OOP principles can be used to create real-world applications that are structured, reusable, and easy to maintain. It also improved problem-solving and logical thinking skills by simulating actual banking operations like account management, deposits, and withdrawals.

The project aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 9 – Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure, as it promotes the development of reliable digital infrastructure and encourages innovation through the creation of efficient and sustainable software systems.
Overall, the project not only strengthened programming knowledge but also emphasized the importance of technology in achieving sustainable and modern banking solutions.
